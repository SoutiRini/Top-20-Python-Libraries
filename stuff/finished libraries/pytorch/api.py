    r"""
    Make a remote call to run ``func`` on worker ``to`` and return an
    :class:`~torch.distributed.rpc.RRef` to the result value immediately.
    Worker ``to`` will be the owner of the returned
    :class:`~torch.distributed.rpc.RRef`, and the worker calling ``remote`` is
    a user. The owner manages the global reference count of its
    :class:`~torch.distributed.rpc.RRef`, and the owner
    :class:`~torch.distributed.rpc.RRef` is only destructed when globally there
    are no living references to it.

    Arguments:
        to (str or WorkerInfo): id or name of the destination worker.
        func (callable): a callable function, such as Python callables, builtin
                         operators (e.g. :meth:`~torch.add`) and annotated
                         TorchScript functions.
        args (tuple): the argument tuple for the ``func`` invocation.
        kwargs (dict): is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the ``func``
                       invocation.

        timeout (float, optional): timeout in seconds for this remote call. If the

                                   ``to_here()``), a timeout will be raised
                                   indicating this failure. A value of 0 indicates
                                   an infinite timeout, i.e. a timeout error will
                                   never be raised. If not provided, the default
                                   value set during initialization or with
                                   ``_set_rpc_timeout`` is used.

    Returns:
        A user :class:`~torch.distributed.rpc.RRef` instance to the result
        value. Use the blocking API :meth:`torch.distributed.rpc.RRef.to_here`
        to retrieve the result value locally.

    .. warning ::
        Using GPU tensors as arguments or return values of ``func`` is not
        supported since we don't support sending GPU tensors over the wire. You
        need to explicitly copy GPU tensors to CPU before using them as
        arguments or return values of ``func``.

    .. warning ::
        The ``remote`` API does not copy storages of argument tensors until
        sending them over the wire, which could be done by a different thread
        depending on the RPC backend type. The caller should make sure that the
        contents of those tensors stay intact until the returned RRef is
        confirmed by the owner, which can be checked using the
        :meth:`torch.distributed.rpc.RRef.confirmed_by_owner` API.

    .. warning ::
        Errors such as timeouts for the ``remote`` API are handled on a
        best-effort basis. This means that when remote calls initiated by
        ``remote`` fail, such as with a timeout error, we take a best-effort
        approach to error handling. This means that errors are handled and set
        on the resulting RRef on an asynchronous basis. If the RRef has not been
        used by the application before this handling (such as ``to_here`` or
        fork call), then future uses of the ``RRef`` will appropriately raise
        errors. However, it is possible that the user application will use the
        ``RRef`` before the errors are handled. In this case, errors may not be
        raised as they have not yet been handled.

    Example::
        Make sure that ``MASTER_ADDR`` and ``MASTER_PORT`` are set properly
        on both workers. Refer to :meth:`~torch.distributed.init_process_group`
        API for more details. For example,

        >>> export MASTER_ADDR=localhost
        >>> export MASTER_PORT=5678

        Then run the following code in two different processes:

        >>> # On worker 0:
        >>> import torch

    Make a blocking RPC call to run function ``func`` on worker ``to``. RPC
    messages are sent and received in parallel to execution of Python code. This
    method is thread-safe.

    Arguments:
        to (str or WorkerInfo): id or name of the destination worker.
        func (callable): a callable function, such as Python callables, builtin
                         operators (e.g. :meth:`~torch.add`) and annotated
                         TorchScript functions.
        args (tuple): the argument tuple for the ``func`` invocation.
        kwargs (dict): is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the ``func``
                       invocation.
        timeout (float, optional): timeout in seconds to use for this RPC. If
                                   the RPC does not complete in this amount of
                                   time, an exception indicating it has
                                   timed out will be raised. A value of 0
                                   indicates an infinite timeout, i.e. a timeout
                                   error will never be raised. If not provided,
                                   the default value set during initialization
                                   or with ``_set_rpc_timeout`` is used.

    Returns:
        Returns the result of running ``func`` with ``args`` and ``kwargs``.

    .. warning ::
        Using GPU tensors as arguments or return values of ``func`` is not
        supported since we don't support sending GPU tensors over the wire. You
        need to explicitly copy GPU tensors to CPU before using them as
        arguments or return values of ``func``.

    Example::
        Make sure that ``MASTER_ADDR`` and ``MASTER_PORT`` are set properly
        on both workers. Refer to :meth:`~torch.distributed.init_process_group`
        API for more details. For example,

        >>> export MASTER_ADDR=localhost
        >>> export MASTER_PORT=5678

        Then run the following code in two different processes:

        >>> # On worker 0:

        The ``rpc_async`` API does not copy storages of argument tensors until
        sending them over the wire, which could be done by a different thread
        depending on the RPC backend type. The caller should make sure that the
        contents of those tensors stay intact until the returned
