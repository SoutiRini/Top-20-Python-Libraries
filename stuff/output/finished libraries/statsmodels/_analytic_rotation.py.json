Then, oblique target rotation is performed towards the target.\n\nParameters ---------- A : numpy matrix non rotated factors k : float parameter, should be positive\n\nReferences ---------- [1] Browne (2001)\n\n- An overview of analytic rotation in exploratory factor analysis\n\n[2] Navarra, Simoncini (2010)\n\n- A guide to empirical orthogonal functions for climate data analysis\n"
