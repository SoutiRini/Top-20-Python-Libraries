'c' for constant and no trend, 'tc' for constant with a linear trend, 'ctt' for constant with a linear and quadratic trend, and 'nc' for no constant.\n\nThe values for the no constant case are taken from the 1996 paper, as they were not updated for 2010 due to the unrealistic assumptions that would underlie such a case. nobs : int or np.inf This is the sample size.\n\nIf the sample size is numpy.inf, then the asymptotic critical values are returned.\n\nReferences ---------- ..
