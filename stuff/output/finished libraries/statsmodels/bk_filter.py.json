If 2d, variables are assumed to be in columns. low : float Minimum period for oscillations, ie., Baxter and King suggest that the Burns-Mitchell U.S. business cycle has 6 for quarterly data and 1.5 for annual data. high : float Maximum period for oscillations BK suggest that the U.S. business cycle has 32 for quarterly data and 8 for annual data. K : int Lead-lag length of the filter. Baxter and King propose a truncation length of 12 for quarterly data and 3 for annual data.\n##### Returns\n* **the weights a[j] are computed **: \n\n* **and theta is a normalizing constant **: \n\n* **Baxter, M. and R.
