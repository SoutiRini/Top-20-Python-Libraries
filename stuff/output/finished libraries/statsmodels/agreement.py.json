The mean of the measures is plotted against their difference.\n\nFor more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bland-Altman_plot\n\nParameters ---------- m1 : array_like A 1-d array. m2 : array_like A 1-d array. sd_limit : float The limit of agreements expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the differences. If `md` is the mean of the differences, and `sd` is the standard deviation of those differences, then the limits of agreement that will be plotted are md +/- sd_limit * sd. The default of 1.96 will produce 95% confidence intervals for the means of the differences. If sd_limit = 0, no limits will be plotted, and the ylimit of the plot defaults to 3 standard deviations on either side of the mean. ax : AxesSubplot If `ax` is None, then a figure is created. If an axis instance is given, the mean difference plot is drawn on the axis. scatter_kwds : dict Options to to style the scatter plot. Accepts any keywords for the matplotlib Axes.scatter plotting method mean_line_kwds : dict Options to to style the scatter plot. Accepts any keywords for the matplotlib Axes.axhline plotting method limit_lines_kwds : dict Options to to style the scatter plot. Accepts any keywords for the matplotlib Axes.axhline plotting method\n##### Returns\n* **.. plot**: \n\n"
