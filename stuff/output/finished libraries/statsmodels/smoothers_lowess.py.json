    "comments": "LOWESS (Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing)\n\nA lowess function that outs smoothed estimates of endog at the given exog values from points (exog, endog)\n\nParameters ---------- endog : 1-D numpy array The y-values of the observed points exog : 1-D numpy array The x-values of the observed points frac : float Between 0 and 1. The fraction of the data used when estimating each y-value. it : int The number of residual-based reweightings to perform. delta : float Distance within which to use linear-interpolation instead of weighted regression. is_sorted : bool If False (default), then the data will be sorted by exog before calculating lowess. If True, then it is assumed that the data is already sorted by exog. missing : str Available options are 'none', 'drop', and 'raise'. If 'none', no nan checking is done. If 'drop', any observations with nans are dropped. If 'raise', an error is raised. Default is 'drop'. return_sorted : bool If True (default), then the returned array is sorted by exog and has missing (nan or infinite) observations removed. If False, then the returned array is in the same length and the same sequence of observations as the input array.\n##### Returns\n* **out**: ndarray, float\n    The returned array is two-dimensional if return_sorted is True, and\n    one dimensional if return_sorted is False.\n    If return_sorted is True, then a numpy array with two columns. The\n    first column contains the sorted x (exog) values and the second column\n    the associated estimated y (endog) values.\n    If return_sorted is False, then only the fitted values are returned,\n    and the observations will be in the same order as the input arrays.\n\n* **Association 74 (368)**: 829-836.\n\n"
