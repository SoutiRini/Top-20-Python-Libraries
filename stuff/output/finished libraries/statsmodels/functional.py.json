    "comments": "Calculate the band depth for a set of functional curves.\n\nBand depth is an order statistic for functional data (see `fboxplot`), with a higher band depth indicating larger \"centrality\".\n\nIn analog to scalar data, the functional curve with highest band depth is called the median curve, and the band made up from the first N/2 of N curves is the 50% central region.\n\nParameters ---------- data : ndarray The vectors of functions to create a functional boxplot from. The first axis is the function index, the second axis the one along which the function is defined.\n\nSo ``data[0, :]`` is the first functional curve. method : {'MBD', 'BD2'}, optional Whether to use the original band depth (with J=2) of [1]_ or the modified band depth.\n\nSee Notes for details.\n##### Returns\n* **..
