    "comments": "Modified Denton's method to convert low-frequency to high-frequency data.\n\nUses proportionate first-differences as the penalty function.\n\nSee notes.\n\nParameters ---------- indicator : array_like A low-frequency indicator series.\n\nIt is assumed that there are no pre-sample indicators.\n\nIe., the first indicators line up with the first benchmark. benchmark : array_like The higher frequency benchmark.\n\nA 1d or 2d data series in columns. If 2d, then M series are assumed. freq : str {\"aq\",\"qm\", \"other\"} The frequency to use in the conversion.\n\n* \"aq\"\n\n- Benchmarking an annual series to quarterly. * \"mq\"\n\n- Benchmarking a quarterly series to monthly. * \"other\"\n\n- Custom stride.\n\nA kwarg, k, must be supplied. **kwargs Additional keyword argument. For example:\n\n* k, an int, the number of high-frequency observations that sum to make an aggregate low-frequency observation. `k` is used with `freq` == \"other\".\n##### Returns\n* **transformed **: ndarray\n    The transformed series.\n\n* **Bloem, A.M, Dippelsman, R.J. and Maehle, N.O.  2001 Quarterly National\n    Accounts Manual--Concepts, Data Sources, and Compilation.
