    "comments": "generic conditional moment test based artificial regression\n\nthis is very experimental, no options implemented yet\n\nso far OPG regression, or artificial regression with Robust Wald test\n\nThe latter is (as far as I can see) the same as an overidentifying test in GMM where the test statistic is the value of the GMM objective function and it is assumed that parameters were estimated with optimial GMM, i.e. the weight matrix equal to the expectation of the score variance.\n"
