    "comments": "Parameters ---------- n_seasons : int >= 0 Number of seasons (e.g. 12 for monthly data and 4 for quarterly data). len_endog : int >= 0 Total number of observations. first_period : int, default: 0 Season of the first observation. As an example, suppose we have monthly data and the first observation is in March (third month of the year). In this case we pass 2 as first_period. (0 for the first season, 1 for the second, ..., n_seasons-1 for the last season). An integer greater than n_seasons-1 are treated in the same way as the integer modulo n_seasons. centered : bool, default: False If True, center (demean) the dummy variables. That is useful in order to get seasonal dummies that are orthogonal to the vector of constant dummy variables (a vector of ones).\n\n\n##### Returns\n* **seasonal_dummies **: ndarray (len_endog x n_seasons-1)\n\n"
