If the correction is a tuple (nobs, df), then the effectsize is corrected to have less bias and a smaller variance. However, the correction can make the effectsize negative. In that case, the effectsize is set to zero. Pederson and Johnson (1990) as referenced in McLaren et all. (1994) cohen : bool If True, then the square root is returned as in the definition of the effect size by Cohen (1977), If False, then the original effect size is returned. axis : int If the probability arrays broadcast to more than 1 dimension, then this is the axis over which the sums are taken.\n##### Returns\n* **effectsize **: float\n    effect size of chisquare test\n\n"
