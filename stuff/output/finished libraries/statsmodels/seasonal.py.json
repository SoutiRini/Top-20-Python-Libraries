    "comments": "Seasonal decomposition using moving averages.\n\nParameters ---------- x : array_like Time series. If 2d, individual series are in columns. x must contain 2 complete cycles. model : {\"additive\", \"multiplicative\"}, optional Type of seasonal component. Abbreviations are accepted. filt : array_like, optional The filter coefficients for filtering out the seasonal component. The concrete moving average method used in filtering is determined by two_sided. period : int, optional Period of the series. Must be used if x is not a pandas object or if the index of x does not have\n\na frequency. Overrides default periodicity of x if x is a pandas object with a timeseries index. two_sided : bool, optional The moving average method used in filtering. If True (default), a centered moving average is computed using the filt. If False, the filter coefficients are for past values only. extrapolate_trend : int or 'freq', optional If set to > 0, the trend resulting from the convolution is linear least-squares extrapolated on both ends (or the single one if two_sided is False) considering this many (+1) closest points. If set to 'freq', use `freq` closest points. Setting this parameter results in no NaN values in trend or resid components.\n##### Returns\n"
