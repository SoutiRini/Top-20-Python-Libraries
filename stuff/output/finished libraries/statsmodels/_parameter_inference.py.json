This is the case if the model was estimated with fit_constrained.\n\n- restricted model with variable addition: If exog_extra is not None, then it is assumed that the current model is a model with zero restrictions and the unrestricted model is given by adding exog_extra as additional explanatory variables.\n\n- unrestricted model with restricted parameters explicitly provided. If params_constrained is not None, then the model is assumed to be for the unrestricted model, but the provided parameters are for the restricted model. TODO: This case will currently only work for `nonrobust` cov_type, otherwise we will also need the restriction matrix provided by the user.\n\n Parameters ---------- exog_extra : None or array_like Explanatory variables that are jointly tested for inclusion in the model, i.e. omitted variables. params_constrained : array_like estimated parameter of the restricted model. This can be the parameter estimate for the current when testing for omitted variables. hypothesis : str, 'joint' (default) or 'separate' If hypothesis is 'joint', then the chisquare test results for the joint hypothesis that all constraints hold is returned. If hypothesis is 'joint', then z-test results for each constraint is returned. This is currently only implemented for cov_type=\"nonrobust\". cov_type : str Warning: only partially implemented so far, currently only \"nonrobust\" and \"HC0\" are supported. If cov_type is None, then the cov_type specified in fit for the Wald tests is used. If the cov_type argument is not None, then it will be used instead of the Wald cov_type given in fit. k_constraints : int or None Number of constraints that were used in the estimation of params restricted relative to the number of exog in the model. This must be provided if no exog_extra are given. If exog_extra is not None, then k_constraints is assumed to be zero if it is None. observed : bool If True, then the observed Hessian is used in calculating the covariance matrix of the score. If false then the expected information matrix is used. This currently only applies to GLM where EIM is available. Warning: This option might still change.\n##### Returns\n* **chi2_stat **: float\n    chisquare statistic for the score test\n\n* **p-value **: float\n    P-value of the score test based on the chisquare distribution.\n\n* **df **: int\n    Degrees of freedom used in the p-value calculation. This is equal\n    to the number of constraints.\n\n* **Status**: experimental, several options are not implemented yet or are not\n\n* **cov_type is 'nonrobust'**: \n\n"
