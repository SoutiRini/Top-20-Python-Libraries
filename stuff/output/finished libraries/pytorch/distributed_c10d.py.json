Additionally, groups should be created in the same order in all processes.\n\nArguments: ranks (list[int]): List of ranks of group members. timeout (timedelta, optional): Timeout for operations executed against the process group. Default value equals 30 minutes. This is only applicable for the ``gloo`` backend. backend (str or Backend, optional): The backend to use. Depending on build-time configurations, valid values are ``gloo`` and ``nccl``. By default uses the same backend as the global group. This field should be given as a lowercase string (e.g., ``\"gloo\"``), which can also be accessed via :class:`Backend` attributes (e.g., ``Backend.GLOO``).\n##### Returns\n"
