(Note: passing keyword arguments to the model is not currently supported.\n\nGive us a shout if you need it.) caffe2_inputs (list of str or caffe2.python.core.BlobReference): the caffe2 Blobs that should be inputs to this network. Must be the same length as sample_arguments prefix_name: prefix name to add to each member of the blob, if None then a fresh prefix pytorch_input_N/ is used\n##### Returns\n"
