We are not using inspect module because its just a wrapper on top of sys._getframe() whose logic is based on accessing source files on disk - exactly what we are trying to avoid here. Same stands for traceback module\n\nThe reason for file system access avoidance is that if code is located on an NFS, file access might be slow\n\nFunction returns a list of tuples (file_name, line_number, function)\n"
