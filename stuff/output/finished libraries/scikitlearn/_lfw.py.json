By default all scikit-learn data is stored in '~/scikit_learn_data' subfolders.\n\nfunneled : bool, default=True Download and use the funneled variant of the dataset.\n\nresize : float, default=0.5 Ratio used to resize the each face picture.\n\ncolor : bool, default=False Keep the 3 RGB channels instead of averaging them to a single gray level channel. If color is True the shape of the data has one more dimension than the shape with color = False.\n\nslice_ : tuple of slice, default=(slice(70, 195), slice(78, 172)) Provide a custom 2D slice (height, width) to extract the 'interesting' part of the jpeg files and avoid use statistical correlation from the background\n\ndownload_if_missing : bool, default=True If False, raise a IOError if the data is not locally available instead of trying to download the data from the source site.\n##### Returns\n* **data **: \n\n"
