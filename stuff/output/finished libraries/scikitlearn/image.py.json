If the patches contain colour information, channels are indexed along the last dimension: RGB patches would have `n_channels=3`.\n\nimage_size : tuple of int (image_height, image_width) or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (image_height, image_width, n_channels) The size of the image that will be reconstructed.\n##### Returns\n* **image **: ndarray of shape image_size\n    The reconstructed image.\n\n"
