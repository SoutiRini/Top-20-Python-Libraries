    "comments": "Dump the dataset in svmlight / libsvm file format.\n\nThis format is a text-based format, with one sample per line. It does not store zero valued features hence is suitable for sparse dataset.\n\nThe first element of each line can be used to store a target variable to predict.\n\nParameters ---------- X : {array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_features) Training vectors, where n_samples is the number of samples and n_features is the number of features.\n\ny : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples (, n_labels)] Target values. Class labels must be an integer or float, or array-like objects of integer or float for multilabel classifications.\n\nf : string or file-like in binary mode If string, specifies the path that will contain the data. If file-like, data will be written to f. f should be opened in binary mode.\n\nzero_based : boolean, optional Whether column indices should be written zero-based (True) or one-based (False).\n\ncomment : string, optional Comment to insert at the top of the file. This should be either a Unicode string, which will be encoded as UTF-8, or an ASCII byte string. If a comment is given, then it will be preceded by one that identifies the file as having been dumped by scikit-learn. Note that not all tools grok comments in SVMlight files.\n\nquery_id : array-like of shape (n_samples,) Array containing pairwise preference constraints (qid in svmlight format).\n\nmultilabel : boolean, optional Samples may have several labels each (see https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html)\n\n.. versionadded:: 0.17 parameter *multilabel* to support multilabel datasets.\n"
