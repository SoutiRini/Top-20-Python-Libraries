    "comments": "Fetch dataset from openml by name or dataset id.\n\nDatasets are uniquely identified by either an integer ID or by a combination of name and version (i.e. there might be multiple versions of the 'iris' dataset). Please give either name or data_id (not both). In case a name is given, a version can also be provided.\n\nRead more in the :ref:`User Guide <openml>`.\n\n.. versionadded:: 0.20\n\n.. note:: EXPERIMENTAL\n\nThe API is experimental (particularly the return value structure), and might have small backward-incompatible changes in future releases.\n\nParameters ---------- name : str, default=None String identifier of the dataset. Note that OpenML can have multiple datasets with the same name.\n\nversion : int or 'active', default='active' Version of the dataset. Can only be provided if also ``name`` is given. If 'active' the oldest version that's still active is used. Since there may be more than one active version of a dataset, and those versions may fundamentally be different from one another, setting an exact version is highly recommended.\n\ndata_id : int, default=None OpenML ID of the dataset. The most specific way of retrieving a dataset. If data_id is not given, name (and potential version) are used to obtain a dataset.\n\ndata_home : str, default=None Specify another download and cache folder for the data sets. By default all scikit-learn data is stored in '~/scikit_learn_data' subfolders.\n\ntarget_column : str, list or None, default='default-target' Specify the column name in the data to use as target. If 'default-target', the standard target column a stored on the server is used. If ``None``, all columns are returned as data and the target is ``None``. If list (of strings), all columns with these names are returned as multi-target (Note: not all scikit-learn classifiers can handle all types of multi-output combinations)\n\ncache : bool, default=True Whether to cache downloaded datasets using joblib.\n\nreturn_X_y : bool, default=False If True, returns ``(data, target)`` instead of a Bunch object. See below for more information about the `data` and `target` objects.\n\nas_frame : bool or 'auto', default=False If True, the data is a pandas DataFrame including columns with appropriate dtypes (numeric, string or categorical). The target is a pandas DataFrame or Series depending on the number of target_columns. The Bunch will contain a ``frame`` attribute with the target and the data. If ``return_X_y`` is True, then ``(data, target)`` will be pandas DataFrames or Series as describe above. If as_frame is 'auto', the data and target will be converted to DataFrame or Series as if as_frame is set to True, unless the dataset is stored in sparse format.\n##### Returns\n* **data **: \n\n* **(data, target) **: tuple if ``return_X_y`` is True\n    .. note\n\n"
