Optionally, an intercept column is added if intercept is set to true.\n\nParameters ---------- X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features) Design matrix, where n_samples is the number of samples and n_features is the number of features.\n\ny : array, shape = [n_samples] Target vector, where n_samples is the number of samples.\n\nindices : array, shape = [n_subpopulation, n_subsamples] Indices of all subsamples with respect to the chosen subpopulation.\n\nfit_intercept : bool Fit intercept or not.\n##### Returns\n* **weights **: array, shape = [n_subpopulation, n_features + intercept]\n    Solution matrix of n_subpopulation solved least square problems.\n\n"
