    "comments": "Computes the Davies-Bouldin score.\n\nThe score is defined as the average similarity measure of each cluster with its most similar cluster, where similarity is the ratio of within-cluster distances to between-cluster distances. Thus, clusters which are farther apart and less dispersed will result in a better score.\n\nThe minimum score is zero, with lower values indicating better clustering.\n\nRead more in the :ref:`User Guide <davies-bouldin_index>`.\n\n.. versionadded:: 0.20\n\nParameters ---------- X : array-like, shape (``n_samples``, ``n_features``) List of ``n_features``-dimensional data points. Each row corresponds to a single data point.\n\nlabels : array-like, shape (``n_samples``,) Predicted labels for each sample.\n##### Returns\n* **score**: float\n    The resulting Davies-Bouldin score.\n\n* **..
