    "comments": "Function cutting the ward tree for a given number of clusters.\n\nParameters ---------- n_clusters : int or ndarray The number of clusters to form.\n\nchildren : ndarray of shape (n_nodes-1, 2) The children of each non-leaf node. Values less than `n_samples` correspond to leaves of the tree which are the original samples. A node `i` greater than or equal to `n_samples` is a non-leaf node and has children `children_[i\n\n- n_samples]`. Alternatively at the i-th iteration, children[i][0] and children[i][1] are merged to form node `n_samples + i`\n\nn_leaves : int Number of leaves of the tree.\n##### Returns\n* **labels **: array [n_samples]\n    cluster labels for each point\n\n"
