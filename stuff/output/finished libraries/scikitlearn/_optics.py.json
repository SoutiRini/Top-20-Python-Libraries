We rely on the fact that clusters are stored with the smaller clusters coming before the larger ones.\n\nParameters ---------- ordering : array-like of shape (n_samples,) The ordering of points calculated by OPTICS\n\nclusters : array-like of shape (n_clusters, 2) List of clusters i.e. (start, end) tuples, as returned by `_xi_cluster`.\n##### Returns\n* **labels **: ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n\n"
