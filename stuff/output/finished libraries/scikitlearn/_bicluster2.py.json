The final score is the sum of similarities divided by the size of the larger set.\n\nRead more in the :ref:`User Guide <biclustering>`.\n\nParameters ---------- a : (rows, columns) Tuple of row and column indicators for a set of biclusters.\n\nb : (rows, columns) Another set of biclusters like ``a``.\n\nsimilarity : 'jaccard' or callable, default='jaccard' May be the string \"jaccard\" to use the Jaccard coefficient, or any function that takes four arguments, each of which is a 1d indicator vector: (a_rows, a_columns, b_rows, b_columns).\n\nReferences ----------\n\n* Hochreiter, Bodenhofer, et. al., 2010. `FABIA: factor analysis for bicluster acquisition <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881408/>`__.\n"
