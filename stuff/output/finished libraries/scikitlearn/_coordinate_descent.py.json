See enet_path for an example of signature\n\npath_params : dictionary Parameters passed to the path function\n\nalphas : array-like, default=None Array of float that is used for cross-validation. If not provided, computed using 'path'.\n\nl1_ratio : float, default=1 float between 0 and 1 passed to ElasticNet (scaling between l1 and l2 penalties). For ``l1_ratio = 0`` the penalty is an L2 penalty. For ``l1_ratio = 1`` it is an L1 penalty. For ``0 < l1_ratio < 1``, the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2.\n\nX_order : {'F', 'C'}, default=None The order of the arrays expected by the path function to avoid memory copies\n\ndtype : a numpy dtype, default=None The dtype of the arrays expected by the path function to avoid memory copies\n"
