The dtype is validated, and if it is an integer or boolean ExtensionArray, it is checked if there are missing values present, and it is converted to the appropriate numpy array. Other dtypes will raise an error.\n\nNon-array indexers (integer, slice, Ellipsis, tuples, ..) are passed through as is.\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.0.0\n\nParameters ---------- array : array-like The array that is being indexed (only used for the length). indexer : array-like or list-like The array-like that's used to index.
