The string could be a URL. Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected. A local file could be: ``file://localhost/path/to/table.parquet``. A file URL can also be a path to a directory that contains multiple partitioned parquet files. Both pyarrow and fastparquet support paths to directories as well as file URLs. A directory path could be: ``file://localhost/path/to/tables``\n\nIf you want to pass in a path object, pandas accepts any ``os.PathLike``.\n\nBy file-like object, we refer to objects with a ``read()`` method, such as a file handler (e.g. via builtin ``open`` function) or ``StringIO``. engine : {'auto', 'pyarrow', 'fastparquet'}, default 'auto' Parquet library to use. If 'auto', then the option ``io.parquet.engine`` is used. The default ``io.parquet.engine`` behavior is to try 'pyarrow', falling back to 'fastparquet' if 'pyarrow' is unavailable. columns : list, default=None If not None, only these columns will be read from the file.\n\n.. versionadded:: 0.21.1 **kwargs Any additional kwargs are passed to the engine.\n##### Returns\n"
