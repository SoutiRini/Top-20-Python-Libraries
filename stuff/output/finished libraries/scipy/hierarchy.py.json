If ``i < n``, ``i``\n    corresponds to an original observation, otherwise it\n    corresponds to a non-singleton cluster.\n\n* **M **: ndarray\n    The leader linkage node id's stored as a k-element 1-D array, where\n    ``k`` is the number of flat clusters found in ``T``. This allows the\n    set of flat cluster ids to be any arbitrary set of ``k`` integers.\n    For example\n\n* **fcluster**: for the creation of flat cluster assignments.\n\n* **to a dataset ``X`` - and a flat cluster assignment array ``T``**: \n\n* **in the dendrogram that are the leaders of each flat cluster**: \n\n* **the flat clusters in ``T``**: \n\n"
