To get a standard Python dictionary, set this option to True. uncompressed_file_name : str, optional This option only has an effect for .sav files written with the /compress option. If a file name is specified, compressed .sav files are uncompressed to this file. Otherwise, readsav will use the `tempfile` module to determine a temporary filename automatically, and will remove the temporary file upon successfully reading it in. verbose : bool, optional Whether to print out information about the save file, including the records read, and available variables.\n##### Returns\n* **idl_dict **: AttrDict or dict\n    If `python_dict` is set to False (default), this function returns a\n    case-insensitive dictionary with item, attribute, and call access\n    to variables. If `python_dict` is set to True, this function\n    returns a Python dictionary with all variable names in lowercase.\n    If `idict` was specified, then variables are written to the\n    dictionary specified, and the updated dictionary is returned.\n\n"
