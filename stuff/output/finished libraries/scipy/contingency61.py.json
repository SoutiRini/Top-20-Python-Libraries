The table contains the observed frequencies (i.e. number of occurrences) in each category.\n\nIn the two-dimensional case, the table is often described as an \"R x C table\". correction : bool, optional If True, *and* the degrees of freedom is 1, apply Yates' correction for continuity.\n\nThe effect of the correction is to adjust each observed value by 0.5 towards the corresponding expected value. lambda_ : float or str, optional. By default, the statistic computed in this test is Pearson's chi-squared statistic [2]_.\n\n`lambda_` allows a statistic from the Cressie-Read power divergence family [3]_ to be used instead.\n\nSee `power_divergence` for details.\n##### Returns\n* **chi2 **: float\n    The test statistic.\n\n* **p **: float\n    The p-value of the test\n\n* **dof **: int\n    Degrees of freedom\n\n* **expected **: ndarray, same shape as `observed`\n    The expected frequencies, based on the marginal sums of the table.\n\n* **required, one could use stats.chisquare.
