    "comments": "Minimization of scalar function of one or more variables using a trust-region algorithm.\n\nOptions for the trust-region algorithm are: initial_trust_radius : float Initial trust radius. max_trust_radius : float Never propose steps that are longer than this value. eta : float Trust region related acceptance stringency for proposed steps. gtol : float Gradient norm must be less than `gtol` before successful termination. maxiter : int Maximum number of iterations to perform. disp : bool If True, print convergence message. inexact : bool Accuracy to solve subproblems. If True requires less nonlinear iterations, but more vector products. Only effective for method trust-krylov.\n\nThis function is called by the `minimize` function. It is not supposed to be called directly.\n"
