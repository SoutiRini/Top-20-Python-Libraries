AT : ndarray or other linear operator The transpose of A. t : int, optional A positive parameter controlling the tradeoff between accuracy versus time and memory usage. itmax : int, optional Use at most this many iterations.\n##### Returns\n* **est **: float\n    An underestimate of the 1-norm of the sparse matrix.\n\n* **v **: ndarray, optional\n    The vector such that ||Av||_1 == est*||v||_1.\n    It can be thought of as an input to the linear operator\n    that gives an output with particularly large norm.\n\n* **w **: ndarray, optional\n    The vector Av which has relatively large 1-norm.\n    It can be thought of as an output of the linear operator\n    that is relatively large in norm compared to the input.\n\n* **nmults **: int, optional\n    The number of matrix products that were computed.\n\n* **nresamples **: int, optional\n    The number of times a parallel column was observed,\n    necessitating a re-randomization of the column.\n\n"
