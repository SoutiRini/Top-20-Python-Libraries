Negative markers are considered background markers which are processed after the other markers. structure : structure element, optional A structuring element defining the connectivity of the object can be provided. If None, an element is generated with a squared connectivity equal to one. output : ndarray, optional An output array can optionally be provided. The same shape as input.\n##### Returns\n* **watershed_ift **: ndarray\n    Output.  Same shape as `input`.\n\n* **.. [1] A.X. Falcao, J.
