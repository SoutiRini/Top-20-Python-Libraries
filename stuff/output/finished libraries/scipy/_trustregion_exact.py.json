U : ndarray Upper triangular matrix resulting of an incomplete Cholesky decomposition of matrix ``A``. k : int Positive integer such that the leading k by k submatrix from `A` is the first non-positive definite leading submatrix.\n##### Returns\n* **delta **: float\n    Amount that should be added to the element (k, k) of the\n    leading k by k submatrix of ``A`` to make it singular.\n\n* **v **: ndarray\n    A vector such that ``v.T B v = 0``. Where B is the matrix A after\n    ``delta`` is added to its element (k, k).\n\n"
