    "comments": "Minimize a scalar function of one or more variables using a truncated Newton (TNC) algorithm.\n\nOptions ------- eps : float or ndarray If `jac is None` the absolute step size used for numerical approximation of the jacobian via forward differences. scale : list of floats Scaling factors to apply to each variable. If None, the factors are up-low for interval bounded variables and 1+|x] fo the others. Defaults to None. offset : float Value to subtract from each variable. If None, the offsets are (up+low)/2 for interval bounded variables and x for the others. disp : bool Set to True to print convergence messages. maxCGit : int Maximum number of hessian*vector evaluations per main iteration. If maxCGit == 0, the direction chosen is -gradient if maxCGit < 0, maxCGit is set to max(1,min(50,n/2)). Defaults to -1. maxiter : int, optional Maximum number of function evaluations. This keyword is deprecated in favor of `maxfun`. Only if `maxfun` is None is this keyword used. eta : float Severity of the line search. If < 0 or > 1, set to 0.25. Defaults to -1. stepmx : float Maximum step for the line search. May be increased during call. If too small, it will be set to 10.0. Defaults to 0. accuracy : float Relative precision for finite difference calculations. If <= machine_precision, set to sqrt(machine_precision). Defaults to 0. minfev : float Minimum function value estimate. Defaults to 0. ftol : float Precision goal for the value of f in the stopping criterion. If ftol < 0.0, ftol is set to 0.0 defaults to -1. xtol : float Precision goal for the value of x in the stopping criterion (after applying x scaling factors). If xtol < 0.0, xtol is set to sqrt(machine_precision). Defaults to -1. gtol : float Precision goal for the value of the projected gradient in the stopping criterion (after applying x scaling factors). If gtol < 0.0, gtol is set to 1e-2 * sqrt(accuracy). Setting it to 0.0 is not recommended. Defaults to -1. rescale : float Scaling factor (in log10) used to trigger f value rescaling.\n\nIf 0, rescale at each iteration.\n\nIf a large value, never rescale.\n\nIf < 0, rescale is set to 1.3. finite_diff_rel_step : None or array_like, optional If `jac in ['2-point', '3-point', 'cs']` the relative step size to use for numerical approximation of the jacobian. The absolute step size is computed as ``h = rel_step * sign(x0) * max(1, abs(x0))``, possibly adjusted to fit into the bounds. For ``method='3-point'`` the sign of `h` is ignored. If None (default) then step is selected automatically. maxfun : int Maximum number of function evaluations. If None, `maxfun` is set to max(100, 10*len(x0)). Defaults to None.\n"
