They are typically\n    not contiguous.  Furthermore, more than one element of a\n    broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location. If you need\n    to write to the arrays, make copies first. While you can set the\n    ``writable`` flag True, writing to a single output value may end up\n    changing more than one location in the output array.\n    .. deprecated\n\n"
