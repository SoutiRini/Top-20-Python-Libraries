    "comments": "Construct an array by repeating A the number of times given by reps.\n\nIf `reps` has length ``d``, the result will have dimension of ``max(d, A.ndim)``.\n\nIf ``A.ndim < d``, `A` is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending new axes. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 3) for 2-D replication, or shape (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication. If this is not the desired behavior, promote `A` to d-dimensions manually before calling this function.\n\nIf ``A.ndim > d``, `reps` is promoted to `A`.ndim by pre-pending 1's to it. Thus for an `A` of shape (2, 3, 4, 5), a `reps` of (2, 2) is treated as (1, 1, 2, 2).\n\nNote : Although tile may be used for broadcasting, it is strongly recommended to use numpy's broadcasting operations and functions.\n\nParameters ---------- A : array_like The input array. reps : array_like The number of repetitions of `A` along each axis.\n##### Returns\n* **c **: ndarray\n    The tiled output array.\n\n* **repeat **: Repeat elements of an array.\n\n* **broadcast_to **: Broadcast an array to a new shape\n\n"
