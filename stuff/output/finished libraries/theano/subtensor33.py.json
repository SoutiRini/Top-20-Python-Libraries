    "comments": "This function checks if the boolean mask arrays in the index have the right shape and converts them to index arrays by calling nonzero. For each boolean mask, we check if the mask has the same shape as the input. This is enforced in NumPy 0.13.0 and newer, but not by earlier versions. If the size is not the same, this method raises an IndexError.\n\n\n"
