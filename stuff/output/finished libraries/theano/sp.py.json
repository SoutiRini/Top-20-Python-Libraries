Outputs a 2D tensor of shape batch_size x output_size.\n\n:param images: 2D tensor containing images on which to apply convolution. Assumed to be of shape batch_size x img_size :param imgshp: tuple containing image dimensions :param maxpoolshp: tuple containing shape of area to max pool over\n\n:return: out1, symbolic result (2D tensor) :return: out2, logical shape of the output\n"
