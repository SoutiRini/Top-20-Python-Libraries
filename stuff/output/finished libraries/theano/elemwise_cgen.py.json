If an entry is an integer, it will become an alias of the entry of that rank. loop_tasks : list of M+1 pieces of code The ith loop_task is a pair of strings, the first string is code to be executed before the ith loop starts, the second one contains code to be executed just before going to the next element of the ith dimension. The last element if loop_tasks is a single string, containing code to be executed at the very end. sub: dictionary Maps 'lv#' to a suitable variable name. The 'lvi' variable corresponds to the ith element of loop_orders.\n"
