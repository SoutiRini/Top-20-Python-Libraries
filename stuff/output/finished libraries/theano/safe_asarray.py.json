    "comments": "Convert the input to a Numpy array.\n\nThis function is almost identical to ``numpy.asarray``, but it should be used instead of its numpy counterpart when a data type is provided in order to perform type conversion if required. The reason is that ``numpy.asarray`` may not actually update the array's data type to the user-provided type. For more information see ticket http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/870.\n\nIn that case, we check that both dtype have the same string description (byte order, basic type, and number of bytes), and return a view with the desired dtype.\n\nThis function's name starts with a '_' to indicate that it is meant to be used internally. It is imported so as to be available directly through theano._asarray\n"
