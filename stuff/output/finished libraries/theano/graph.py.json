    "comments": "A contextmanager that is used in inherit_stack_trace and keeps track of all the newly created varaible nodes inside an optimization. A list of new_nodes is instantiated but will be filled in a lazy manner (when Variable.notify_construction_observers is called).\n\n`observer` is the entity that updates the new_nodes list. construction_observers is a list inside Variable class and contains a list of observer functions. The observer functions inside construction_observers are only called when a variable node is instantiated (where Variable.notify_construction_observers is called). When the observer function is called, a new variable node is added to the new_nodes list.\n\n Parameters ---------- new_nodes A list of all the variable nodes that are created inside the optimization.\n\nyields new_nodes list.\n"
