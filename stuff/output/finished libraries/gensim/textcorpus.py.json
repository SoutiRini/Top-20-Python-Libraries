    "comments": "Generate the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top (including top itself), it yields a 4-tuple (depth, dirpath, dirnames, filenames).\n\nParameters ---------- top : str Root directory. topdown : bool, optional If True\n\n- you can modify dirnames in-place. onerror : function, optional Some function, will be called with one argument, an OSError instance. It can report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception to abort the walk. Note that the filename is available as the filename attribute of the exception object. followlinks : bool, optional If True\n\n- visit directories pointed to by symlinks, on systems that support them. depth : int, optional Height of file-tree, don't pass it manually (this used as accumulator for recursion).\n\nNotes ----- This is a mostly copied version of `os.walk` from the Python 2 source code. The only difference is that it returns the depth in the directory tree structure at which each yield is taking place.\n\nYields ------ (int, str, list of str, list of str) Depth, current path, visited directories, visited non-directories.\n\nSee Also -------- `os.walk documentation <https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk>`_\n"
