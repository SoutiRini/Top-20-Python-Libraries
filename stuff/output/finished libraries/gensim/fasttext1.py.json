Called internally from :meth:`gensim.models.fasttext.FastText.train()`.\n\nThis is the non-optimized, Python version. If you have cython installed, gensim will use the optimized version from fasttext_inner instead.\n\nParameters ---------- model : :class:`~gensim.models.fasttext.FastText` `FastText` instance. sentences : iterable of iterables Iterable of the sentences directly from disk/network. alpha : float Learning rate. work : :class:`numpy.ndarray` Private working memory for each worker. neu1 : :class:`numpy.ndarray` Private working memory for each worker.\n##### Returns\n"
