    "comments": "Convert a figure to a static image and write it to a file or writeable object\n\nParameters ---------- fig: Figure object or dict representing a figure\n\nfile: str or writeable A string representing a local file path or a writeable object (e.g. an open file descriptor)\n\nformat: str or None The desired image format. One of\n\n- 'png'\n\n- 'jpg' or 'jpeg'\n\n- 'webp'\n\n- 'svg'\n\n- 'pdf'\n\n- 'eps' (Requires the poppler library to be installed)\n\nIf not specified and `file` is a string then this will default to the file extension. If not specified and `file` is not a string then this will default to `plotly.io.config.default_format`\n\nwidth: int or None The width of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale` property is 1.0, this will also be the width of the exported image in physical pixels.\n\nIf not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_width`\n\nheight: int or None The height of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale` property is 1.0, this will also be the height of the exported image in physical pixels.\n\nIf not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_height`\n\nscale: int or float or None The scale factor to use when exporting the figure. A scale factor larger than 1.0 will increase the image resolution with respect to the figure's layout pixel dimensions. Whereas as scale factor of less than 1.0 will decrease the image resolution.\n\nIf not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_scale`\n\nvalidate: bool True if the figure should be validated before being converted to an image, False otherwise.\n##### Returns\n"
