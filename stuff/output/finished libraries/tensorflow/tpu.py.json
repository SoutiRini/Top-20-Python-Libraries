In general, these ops should have\n  no inputs and no consumers. These can often be left behind due to graph\n  construction rewiring (for instance TF-Hub). While they never execute,\n  they will cause XLA compile to fail so we strip them from XLA compile by\n  removing the tpu_replicate attribute.\n\n"
