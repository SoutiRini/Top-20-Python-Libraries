These include _Send, _Recv, _HostSend, _HostRecv, _Retval ops. 2) As a consequence of 1, the nodes that receive input directly from such send- and recv-type ops will have different input names. 3) The parallel_iteration attribute of while-loop Enter ops are set to 1.\n##### Args\n* **debug_graph_def**: The debugger-decorated `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`, with the\n  debugger-inserted Copy* and Debug* nodes.\n\n##### Returns\n"
