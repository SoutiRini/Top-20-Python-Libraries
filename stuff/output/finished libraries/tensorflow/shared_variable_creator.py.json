    "comments": "Construct the variable creator function for device `device_id`.\n\nConstructs custom variable creator functions for the given device. On first device (device_id == 0), it creates the variable using the `next_creator`, and stores it in the provided `shared_variable_store`. On all other devices (device_id > 0), it tries to re-use the variable already created with the same name. If no such variable exists, it throws an error. Additionally, we de-uniquify variable names before checking for matches. This helps re-use variables which are intended to be the same but have different names due to variable uniquification happening upstream. Since this might mean we may have multiple variables with the same canonical name, we store them in a list per canonical name and return them in the same order as well.\n##### Args\n* **shared_variable_store**: A dictionary that we will use to store variables\n  created on the first device, and re-used by creators for other devices.\n\n* **device_id**: Integer index of the device whose creator should be\n  constructed.\n\n##### Returns\n"
