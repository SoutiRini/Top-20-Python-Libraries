    "comments": "Returns a iterator for reading `Event` protocol buffers from an event file.\n\nYou can use this function to read events written to an event file. It returns a Python iterator that yields `Event` protocol buffers.\n\nExample: Print the contents of an events file.\n\n```python for e in tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(path to events file): print(e) ```\n\nExample: Print selected summary values.\n\n```python # This example supposes that the events file contains summaries with a # summary value tag 'loss'.\n\nThese could have been added by calling # `add_summary()`, passing the output of a scalar summary op created with # with: `tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', loss_tensor)`. for e in tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(path to events file): for v in e.summary.value: if v.tag == 'loss': print(v.simple_value) ``` Example: Continuously check for new summary values.\n\n```python summaries = tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(path to events file) while True: for e in summaries: for v in e.summary.value: if v.tag == 'loss': print(v.simple_value) # Wait for a bit before checking the file for any new events time.sleep(wait time) ```\n\nSee the protocol buffer definitions of [Event](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/util/event.proto) and [Summary](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/summary.proto) for more information about their attributes.\n##### Args\n* **path**: The path to an event file created by a `SummaryWriter`.\n\n##### Returns\n"
