Defaults to the\n  default session.\n\n* **coord**: Optional `Coordinator` for coordinating the started threads.\n\n* **daemon**: Whether the threads should be marked as `daemons`, meaning\n  they don't block program exit.\n\n* **start**: Set to `False` to only create the threads, not start them.\n\n* **collection**: A `GraphKey` specifying the graph collection to\n  get the queue runners from.  Defaults to `GraphKeys.QUEUE_RUNNERS`.\n\n##### Returns\n"
