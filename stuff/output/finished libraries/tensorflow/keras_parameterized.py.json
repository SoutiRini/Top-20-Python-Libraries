This allows stacking the Keras parameterized decorators w/ each other, and to apply them to test methods that have already been marked with an absl parameterized decorator.\n\nOtherwise, treat the obj as a single method and apply the decorator directly.\n##### Args\n* **test_or_class**: A test method (that may have already been decorated with a\n  parameterized decorator, or a test class that extends\n  keras_parameterized.TestCase\n\n* **single_method_decorator**: A parameterized decorator intended for a single test method.\n\n##### Returns\n"
