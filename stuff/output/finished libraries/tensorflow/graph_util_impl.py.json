Here we identify and remove them, returning an equivalent graph. To be specific, CheckNumerics nodes are always removed, and Identity nodes that aren't involved in control edges are spliced out so that their input and outputs are directly connected.\n##### Args\n* **input_graph**: Model to analyze and prune.\n\n* **protected_nodes**: An optional list of names of nodes to be kept\n  unconditionally. This is for example useful to preserve Identity output\n  nodes.\n\n##### Returns\n"
