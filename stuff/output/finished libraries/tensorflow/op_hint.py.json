Note: only one of session or graph_def should be used, not both.\n##### Args\n* **session**: A TensorFlow session that contains the graph to convert.\n\n* **graph_def**: A graph def that we should convert.\n\n* **write_callback**: A function pointer that can be used to write intermediate\n  steps of graph transformation (optional).\n\n##### Returns\n"
