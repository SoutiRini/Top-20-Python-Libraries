This ensures that `family` is always the prefix of the tag (and unmodified), while ensuring the scope respects the outer scope from this summary was created.\n##### Args\n* **name**: A name for the generated summary node.\n\n* **family**: Optional; if provided, used as the prefix of the summary tag name.\n\n* **default_name**: Optional; if provided, used as default name of the summary.\n\n* **values**: Optional; passed as `values` parameter to name_scope.\n\n* **elds**: \n\n"
