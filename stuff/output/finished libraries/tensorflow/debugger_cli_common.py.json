    "comments": "Wrap RichTextLines according to maximum number of columns.\n\nProduces a new RichTextLines object with the text lines, font_attr_segs and annotations properly wrapped. This ought to be used sparingly, as in most cases, command handlers producing RichTextLines outputs should know the screen/panel width via the screen_info kwarg and should produce properly length-limited lines in the output accordingly.\n##### Args\n* **inp**: Input RichTextLines object.\n\n* **cols**: Number of columns, as an int.\n\n##### Returns\n* **2) A list of new (wrapped) line index. For example, if the original input\n  consists of three lines and only the second line is wrapped, and it's\n  wrapped into two lines, this return value will be**: [0, 1, 3].\n\n"
