For all ops in the graph, the `check_numerics` op for all of its (`half`, `float`, or `double`) inputs is guaranteed to run before the `check_numerics` op on any of its outputs.\n\nNote: This API is not compatible with the use of `tf.cond` or `tf.while_loop`, and will raise a `ValueError` if you attempt to call it in such a graph.\n##### Returns\n"
