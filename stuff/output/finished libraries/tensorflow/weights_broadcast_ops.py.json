When computing a weighted average, use this function to broadcast `weights` before summing them; e.g., `reduce_sum(w * v) / reduce_sum(_broadcast_weights(w, v))`.\n##### Args\n* **weights**: `Tensor` whose shape is broadcastable to `values` according to the\n  rules of `assert_broadcastable`.\n\n* **values**: `Tensor` of any shape.\n\n##### Returns\n"
