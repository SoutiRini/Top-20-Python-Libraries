Defaults to all placeholders. visited_ops: A set of operations which were visited in a prior pass. op_outputs: A defaultdict containing the outputs of an op which are to be copied into the new subgraph. add_sources: A boolean indicating whether placeholders which are not in sources should be allowed.\n##### Returns\n"
