The list could be empty, if the gradient\n  tensor is not executed in the `tf.Session.run()` call that generated\n  the `dump`. The list could also contain multiple values of the gradient\n  tensor, e.g., if gradient tensor is computed repeatedly in a\n  `tf.while_loop` during the run that generated the `dump`.\n\n"
