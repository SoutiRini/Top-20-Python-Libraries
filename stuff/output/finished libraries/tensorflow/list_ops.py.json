    "comments": "Converts shape to a format understood by list_ops for element_shape.\n\nIf `shape` is already a `Tensor` it is returned as-is. We do not perform a type check here.\n\nIf shape is None or a TensorShape with unknown rank, -1 is returned.\n\nIf shape is a scalar, an int32 tensor with empty list is returned. Note we do directly return an empty list since ops.convert_to_tensor would conver it to a float32 which is not a valid type for element_shape.\n\nIf shape is a sequence of dims, None's in the list are replaced with -1. We do not check the dtype of the other dims.\n##### Args\n* **shape**: Could be None, Tensor, TensorShape or a list of dims (each dim could\n  be a None, scalar or Tensor).\n\n##### Returns\n"
