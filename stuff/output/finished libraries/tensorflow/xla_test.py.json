This gives fine-grained control over which\n  portions of the graph will be compiled as a single unit. Compiling\n  gradients separately may yield better performance for some graphs.\n  The scope is named based on the scope of the forward computation as well\n  as the name of the gradients. As a result, the gradients will be compiled\n  in a scope that is separate from both the forward computation, and from\n  other gradients.\n\n"
