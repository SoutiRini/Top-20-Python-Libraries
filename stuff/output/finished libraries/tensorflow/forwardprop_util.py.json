    "comments": "Temporarily push or pop transient state for accumulators in the active set.\n\nAllows an accumulator which is currently processing an operation to temporarily reset its state. This is useful when building forwardprop versions of functions, where an accumulator will trigger function building and then must process captured symbolic tensors while building it. Without pushing and popping, accumulators ignore operations executed as a direct result of their own jvp computations.\n\nYields: None (used for its side effect).\n"
