    "comments": "Imports the graph from `graph_def` into the current default `Graph`.\n\nThis function provides a way to import a serialized TensorFlow [`GraphDef`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/core/framework/graph.proto) protocol buffer, and extract individual objects in the `GraphDef` as `tf.Tensor` and `tf.Operation` objects. Once extracted, these objects are placed into the current default `Graph`. See `tf.Graph.as_graph_def` for a way to create a `GraphDef` proto.\n##### Args\n* **graph_def**: A `GraphDef` proto containing operations to be imported into the\n  default graph.\n\n* **input_map**: A dictionary mapping input names (as strings) in `graph_def` to\n  `Tensor` objects. The values of the named input tensors in the imported\n  graph will be re-mapped to the respective `Tensor` values.\n\n* **return_elements**: A list of strings containing operation names in `graph_def`\n  that will be returned as `Operation` objects; and/or tensor names in\n  `graph_def` that will be returned as `Tensor` objects.\n\n* **validate_colocation_constraints**: Whether to validate colocation constraints.\n\n* **name**: (Optional.) A prefix that will be prepended to the names in\n  `graph_def`. Note that this does not apply to imported function names.\n  Defaults to `\"import\"`.\n\n* **producer_op_list**: (Optional.) An `OpList` proto with the (possibly stripped)\n  list of `OpDef`s used by the producer of the graph. If provided,\n  unrecognized attrs for ops in `graph_def` that have their default value\n  according to `producer_op_list` will be removed. This will allow some more\n  `GraphDef`s produced by later binaries to be accepted by earlier binaries.\n\n##### Returns\n"
