The identity's gradient function is also the identity function, except it asserts that the gradient equals `expected_gradient` and has dtype `expected_dtype`.\n##### Args\n* **expected_gradient**: The gradient function asserts that the gradient is this\n  value.\n\n* **expected_dtype**: The gradient function asserts the gradient has this dtype.\n\n##### Returns\n"
