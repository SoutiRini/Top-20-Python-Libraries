    "comments": "Given a sequence of `Path`\\s, `~.Transform`\\s objects, and offsets, as found in a `~.PathCollection`, returns the bounding box that encapsulates all of them.\n\nParameters ---------- master_transform : `~.Transform` Global transformation applied to all paths. paths : list of `Path` transforms : list of `~.Affine2D` offsets : (N, 2) array-like offset_transform : `~.Affine2D` Transform applied to the offsets before offsetting the path.\n\nNotes ----- The way that *paths*, *transforms* and *offsets* are combined follows the same method as for collections:\n\nEach is iterated over independently, so if you have 3 paths, 2 transforms and 1 offset, their combinations are as follows:\n\n(A, A, A), (B, B, A), (C, A, A)\n"
