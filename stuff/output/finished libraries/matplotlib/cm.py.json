In Matplotlib 3.5, you will no longer be able to modify the global colormaps in-place.\n\nParameters ---------- name : `matplotlib.colors.Colormap` or str or None, default: None If a `.Colormap` instance, it will be returned. Otherwise, the name of a colormap known to Matplotlib, which will be resampled by *lut*. The default, None, means :rc:`image.cmap`. lut : int or None, default: None If *name* is not already a Colormap instance and *lut* is not None, the colormap will be resampled to have *lut* entries in the lookup table.\n"
